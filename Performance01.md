The [utricle and saccule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utricle_(ear)#/media/File:Blausen_0329_EarAnatomy_InternalEar.png) contain hair cells, which are the
peripheral sensors of change in gravity that transmit signals
regarding these changes to the neural components
of the vestibular system. Although the fundamental neural
pathways, especially the vestibular reflex pathways,
have been investigated extensively, the principals underlying
the functional development of this system are under
study at present. The objective of this review is to identify
the gravity-sensing components of the vestibular system
and to present an overview of the research performed on
their development. The second part of this review is
focused on one important aspect of development, the
emergence of electrical excitability using the chick tangential
vestibular nucleus as a model. The importance of
this research to understanding vestibular compensation
and vestibular disturbance during spaceflight is considered.
Because there is a conservation of the fundamental
pathways and function in vertebrate phylogeny from
birds through mammals, findings from studies on avians
should contribute significantly to understanding the
mechanisms operating in mammals. Also, we expect that
as the events and basic mechanisms underlying normal
vestibular development are revealed, these will provide
practical tools to investigate the pattern of recovery from
dysfunction of the vestibular system. This is related to the
evidence suggesting that recovery of function in different
systems and cell lines, including neurons, involves repeating
certain patterns established during development.
