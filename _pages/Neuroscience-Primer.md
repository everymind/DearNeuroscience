This Dear Neuroscience event is themed around our senses of **touch** and **proprioception**, or **our ability to know where our body parts are without actively looking at them** - for instance, can you clap your hands with your eyes closed? For this event, we are excited to be working closely with physiologists, neurologists, and performance artists, largely enabled by a fantastic collaboration with the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/). Other collaborators include [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/) and researchers from the [MA Art and Science course at University Arts London](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/fine-art/postgraduate/ma-art-and-science-csm).
