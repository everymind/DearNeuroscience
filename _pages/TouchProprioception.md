This Dear Neuroscience event is themed around our senses of **touch** and **proprioception**, or **our ability to know where our body parts are without actively looking at them** - for instance, can you clap your hands with your eyes closed? For this event, we are excited to be working closely with physiologists, neurologists, and performance artists, largely enabled by a fantastic collaboration with the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/). Other collaborators include [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/) and researchers from the [MA Art and Science course at University Arts London](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/fine-art/postgraduate/ma-art-and-science-csm).

This event was held on **Friday, 24 May 2019, from noon to 5pm at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://goo.gl/maps/BtRHagPzAuF2)**. We explored questions from YOU about our abilities to not only move, touch, and feel the world around us, but also [to sense our own body's movement and position in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception).

Note: **PLEASE COME DRESSED FOR MOVEMENT**, as many of our workshops involve active participation and movement.

Closing and Acknowledgements

This event will be a festival-style gathering, with performances, interactive installations, small-group discussions, games, workshops, and more! Feel free to drop in for one or two activities or stay for the whole 5 hours. **School groups and families are more than welcome!**

## Accessibility and Inclusion at our event

This event will be held on the ground floor and there is step-free access to the event space. While most of the event involves moving and standing, we also have chairs available for those who are not able to stand for long periods of time.

The event space itself is a large lecture theater, with flourescent lighting and high ceilings. Two of the walls in this space are floor-to-ceiling windows, one which faces out towards the street, and another which faces our front reception area. Please note that the temperature in this lecture theater is often colder than most other spaces in our building, so if you are prone to feeling cold please bring an extra layer. Public toilets are also on the ground floor, just across the front reception lobby from the lecture theater.

None of the performances or workshops will be using flashing/strobing lights, nor do we plan to have any sudden, loud noises. Background music for performances and workshops may be played on small portable speakers. Event attendees are also welcome to arrive 15-20 minutes early, if you would prefer to get settled into the event space before it gets crowded.

If you have any additional concerns or questions, please get in touch by emailing [everymindonline@protonmail.com](mailto:everymindonline@protonmail.com).

"Until very recently, our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in representing complex tools and
their usage came exclusively from studies of brain-injured patients suffering from apraxia – a disorder of learned, voluntary actions, or _skills_."

"Peripersonal space is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies. Objects within peripersonal space can be grasped and manipulated; objects located beyond this space (in what is often termed ‘extrapersonal space’) cannot normally be reached without moving toward them, or else their movement toward us."

"The unloading of the otoliths and other graviceptors when passing from hypergravity to 0g might therefore be sensed as negative gravity, i.e., a gravitational pull in the upward direction."

"The rapid acquisition of motor programming by precocial mammals in minutes after birth is consistent with this hypothesis, but the slow development of motor skills in altricial species and the plasticity of vestibular perception in adults suggest that gravity experience is required for the tuning of graviceptors."  
_By Marc Jamon_

"In other words, this network is proposed to sub-serve the representation and protection of near peripersonal space or safety margin around the body, with a specific emphasis on two vulnerable body parts, the head and the arm/hand unit."

### [2015: Peripersonal space in the brain](https://github.com/everymind/DearNeuroscience/blob/gh-pages/assets/papers/2015_PeripersonalSpaceInTheBrain_GdPellegrino-ELadavas.pdf)

"These studies reveal how the brain links somatosensory information from our body to visual and auditory signals arising from objects in the space immediately around our body, using a bodypart-centered frame of reference, within a network of highly interconnected frontal and parietal regions that participate in the control of movements. While most studies on PPS (peri-personal space) have ignored social information and typically used non-biological stimuli in a neutral environment, there is currently great interest in understanding the mechanisms and neural underpinnings of how the presence of others affect our representation of the space around us."  
_By Giuseppe di Pellegrino and Elisabetta Làdavas_
