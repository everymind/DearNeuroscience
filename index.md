# Upcoming event on May 24, 2019: "Touch and Proprioception"

Our next Dear Neuroscience event is themed around our senses of **touch** and **proprioception**, or **our ability to know where our body parts are without actively looking at them** - for instance, can you clap your hands with your eyes closed? For this event, we are excited to be working closely with physiologists, neurologists, and performance artists, largely enabled by a fantastic collaboration with the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/). Other collaborators include [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/) and researchers from the [MA Art and Science course at University Arts London](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/fine-art/postgraduate/ma-art-and-science-csm). 

This event will be held on **Friday, 24 May 2019, from noon to 5pm at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://goo.gl/maps/BtRHagPzAuF2)**. We want to explore questions from YOU about our abilities to not only move, touch, and feel the world around us, but also [to sense our own body's movement and position in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception). 

Note: **PLEASE COME DRESSED FOR MOVEMENT**, as many of our workshops involve active participation and movement.

## Accessibility and Inclusion at our event

This event will be held on the ground floor and there is step-free access to the event space. While most of the event involves moving and standing, we also have chairs available for those who are not able to stand for long periods of time.

The event space itself is a large lecture theater, with flourescent lighting and high ceilings. Two of the walls in this space are floor-to-ceiling windows, one which faces out towards the street, and another which faces our front reception area. Please note that the temperature in this lecture theater is often colder than most other spaces in our building, so if you are prone to feeling cold please bring an extra layer. Public toilets are also on the ground floor, just across the front reception lobby from the lecture theater.

None of the performances or workshops will be using flashing/strobing lights, nor do we plan to have any sudden, loud noises. Background music for performances and workshops may be played on small portable speakers. Event attendees are also welcome to arrive 15-20 minutes early, if you would prefer to get settled into the event space before it gets crowded. 

If you have any additional concerns or questions, please get in touch by emailing [everymindonline@protonmail.com](mailto:everymindonline@protonmail.com).

"Until very recently, our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in representing complex tools and
their usage came exclusively from studies of brain-injured patients suffering from apraxia – a disorder of learned, voluntary actions, or *skills*."

"Peripersonal space is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies. Objects within peripersonal space can be grasped and manipulated; objects located beyond this space (in what is often termed ‘extrapersonal space’) cannot normally be reached without moving toward them, or else their movement toward us."

"The unloading of the otoliths and other graviceptors when passing from hypergravity to 0g might therefore be sensed as negative gravity, i.e., a gravitational pull in the upward direction."

"The rapid acquisition of motor programming by precocial mammals in minutes after birth is consistent with this hypothesis, but the slow development of motor skills in altricial species and the plasticity of vestibular perception in adults suggest that gravity experience is required for the tuning of graviceptors."

"In other words, this network is proposed to sub-serve the representation and protection of near peripersonal space or safety margin around the body, with a specific emphasis on two vulnerable body parts, the head and the arm/hand unit."

### [2015: Peripersonal space in the brain](https://github.com/everymind/DearNeuroscience/blob/gh-pages/assets/papers/2015_PeripersonalSpaceInTheBrain_GdPellegrino-ELadavas.pdf)

"These studies reveal how the brain links somatosensory information from our body to visual and auditory signals arising from objects in the space immediately around our body, using a bodypart-centered frame of reference, within a network of highly interconnected frontal and parietal regions that participate in the control of movements. While most studies on PPS (peri-personal space) have ignored social information and typically used non-biological stimuli in a neutral environment, there is currently great interest in understanding the mechanisms and neural underpinnings of how the presence of others affect our representation of the space around us."  
*By Giuseppe di Pellegrino and Elisabetta Làdavas*

# Participate! 

**If you would like to submit a question,** inspired by something in your daily life, that makes you wonder about the brain and our senses of touch and proprioception, please submit your question(s) via [this form](https://forms.gle/u4KBCusofMndqjNa7)! Your questions will be used as input to shape and define upcoming Dear Neuroscience events. 

# What is "Dear Neuroscience"?

"Dear Neuroscience" is an event series that explores new ways of conducting neuroscience research by **bringing together scientists, artists, teachers, clinicians, parents, and children to co-create sensory explorations of neural phenomena "in the wild"**. We want to ask our audience, "What's something in your daily life that makes you wonder about brains? What are your burning questions for neuroscience? What experiences have you had in the 'real world' that you hope neuroscientists are studying?"

We believe that neuroscience research can learn a lot from projects that involve our audience at all stages of the research process: picking the questions to study, designing the study setup, running the experiment, analysing the results, and discussing our conclusions. Changing our tactics as a neuroscience community in this way allows us to **harness the many direct and personal experiences with brains that every living person has while trying to navigate a complex and highly interconnected society**. This intuition for how brains work "in the real world" is an enormously valuable perspective that is difficult to access in a traditional neuroscience laboratory. 

**We hope to access this "beyond the lab" perspective through the Dear Neuroscience events**. A fundamental goal of each event is to generate a list of testable hypotheses which can guide or expand existing research projects, or motivate new research programmes based on well-documented interest and/or robust anecdotal evidence. We also hope to connect potential collaborators who are looking for a **community of researchers eager to engage in broad topics of study that require expertise from a variety of disciplines**.

# Past Events

## March 29, 2019: "A Vestibular Circus"

Join us for a mini-event to whet your appetite for "neuroscience in the wild"! Teaching staff from the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/) share how they study and mentor humans who push their vestibular systems to awe-inspiring extremes. We'll discuss some case studies from both the circus world and neuroscience labs, then try out some of the drills and interventions used in the National Centre's student curriculum!

This mini-event will take place at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/BtRHagPzAuF2) on **Friday, March 29, 2019, starting at 4:30pm.**
