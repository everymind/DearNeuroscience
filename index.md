# Upcoming event on May 24, 2019: "Touch and Proprioception"

Our next Dear Neuroscience event is themed around our senses of **touch** and **proprioception**, or **our ability to know where our body parts are without actively looking at them** - for instance, can you clap your hands with your eyes closed? For this event, we are excited to be working closely with physiologists, neurologists, and performance artists, largely enabled by a fantastic collaboration with the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/). Other collaborators include [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/) and researchers from the [MA Art and Science course at University Arts London](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/fine-art/postgraduate/ma-art-and-science-csm). 

This event will be held on **Friday, 24 May 2019, from noon to 5pm at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://goo.gl/maps/BtRHagPzAuF2)**. We want to explore questions from YOU about our abilities to not only move, touch, and feel the world around us, but also [to sense our own body's movement and position in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception). 

Note: **PLEASE COME DRESSED FOR MOVEMENT**, as many of our workshops involve active participation and movement.

# Participate! 

**If you would like to submit a question,** inspired by something in your daily life, that makes you wonder about the brain and our senses of touch and proprioception, please submit your question(s) via [this form](https://forms.gle/u4KBCusofMndqjNa7)! Your questions will be used as input to shape and define upcoming Dear Neuroscience events.

**If you would like to host an activity booth** (bring an interactive installation, lead a small-group discussion, conduct a citizen science study, etc.) at "Dear Neuroscience: Touch and Proprioception", [please apply here!](https://forms.gle/h2WeZjoKs4fTiPGfA) **Deadline for applications: May 12, 2019**

# What is "Dear Neuroscience"?

"Dear Neuroscience" is an event series that explores new ways of conducting neuroscience research by **bringing together scientists, artists, teachers, clinicians, parents, and children to co-create sensory explorations of neural phenomena "in the wild"**. We want to ask our audience, "What's something in your daily life that makes you wonder about brains? What are your burning questions for neuroscience? What experiences have you had in the 'real world' that you hope neuroscientists are studying?"

We believe that neuroscience research can learn a lot from projects that involve our audience at all stages of the research process: picking the questions to study, designing the study setup, running the experiment, analysing the results, and discussing our conclusions. Changing our tactics as a neuroscience community in this way allows us to **harness the many direct and personal experiences with brains that every living person has while trying to navigate a complex and highly interconnected society**. This intuition for how brains work "in the real world" is an enormously valuable perspective that is difficult to access in a traditional neuroscience laboratory. 

**We hope to access this "beyond the lab" perspective through the Dear Neuroscience events**. A fundamental goal of each event is to generate a list of testable hypotheses which can guide or expand existing research projects, or motivate new research programmes based on well-documented interest and/or robust anecdotal evidence. We also hope to connect potential collaborators who are looking for a **community of researchers eager to engage in broad topics of study that require expertise from a variety of disciplines**.

# Past Events

## March 29, 2019: "A Vestibular Circus"

Join us for a mini-event to whet your appetite for "neuroscience in the wild"! Teaching staff from the [National Centre for Circus Arts](https://www.nationalcircus.org.uk/) share how they study and mentor humans who push their vestibular systems to awe-inspiring extremes. We'll discuss some case studies from both the circus world and neuroscience labs, then try out some of the drills and interventions used in the National Centre's student curriculum!

This mini-event will take place at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/BtRHagPzAuF2) on **Friday, March 29, 2019, starting at 4:30pm.**
